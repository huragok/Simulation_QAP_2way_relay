function map = get_map_core(Q, M)
%   map = get_map_core(Q, M)
%   Get the core remapping for a Q-QAM constellation according to
%   TSGR1#19(01)0237
% _________________________________________________________________________
%	Inputs:
% 		Q:      scalar, size of the constellation Q must be 16 or 64
%       M:      scalar, total number of transmissions
%	Outputs:
%		map:    M-by-Q matrix, the mapping at each transmission
